This project aims to use the monitor's  mutex characteristics with one client & 10 worker
threads. The client is responible for adding "Task" to the BlockingFIFO. The worker threads
in the thread pool are waiting to be notified and then take the task to execute.

1. Implements the Blocking FIFO in Java.
2. Implements thread pools and the client to compete two monitors to finish the tasks' scheduling.
